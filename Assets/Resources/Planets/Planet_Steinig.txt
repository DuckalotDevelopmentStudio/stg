Steinig
Steinig is a terrestrial planet orbiting Ankol-1. It has a large supply of machine parts because of the amount of  factories that have been built on this planet. The terrain of the planet is very dangerous for ships, there are rocky hills, holes and large spiky stones reaching high into the sky everywhere, three ships crashed on the harsh landscape of Steinig, Roter-1, Roter-3 and Teras-2, killing 53 people. The company "Ferzar" owns the planet, all ships that try to enter will be checked. Ferzar needs weapons for guarding and for other planets, they will pay high prices for them.
