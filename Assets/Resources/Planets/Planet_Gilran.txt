Gilran
Gilran is a tundra planet, famous for 2 crashes, Kerlonib was a mining ship that tried to land, but had too much speed, and it crashed. The second ship was Barney, a drone ship that crashed in one of the lakes of Gilran. Gilran is a relatively flat planet with a lot of lakes made out of acid, making the planet a perfect place for factories. This is because they can dump their waste in the lakes without having to worry about polluting it since it's already quite dead. The planet is owned by the "Union of Gilran Socialist Republics", After the USSR fell, the people who still believed in communism flew to the last place that wasn't corrupted by capitalism, Gilran. They started a colony there, today this planet is a military power house making millions of weapons every day. But its comes at a cost, they need fuel, a lot of it for powering their factories.
