Higoon
Higoon is a terrestrial planet orbiting Ankol-1. Higoon has a very large underground supply of iron and is a popular planet for mining. Humans always tried to colonize Higoon but never succeeded in doing so after the failed launch of Volget-3 when the pod crashed on the hard stony surface of Higoon, killing all the 15 people on the ship, and the tragedy of Foleg-11, when the ship exploded in atmosphere leaving earth killing the crew and destroying half of the launch center, 532 people died. This marked the end of the mission. The planet is barren with hard stony soil and it inhabits no lifeforms, it have a very thin atmosphere making it habitable in the future. A Company called "Galliz" is the number #1 mining company on the planet. Due to a... fault in their system some machines overheated and broke down. They are in great need of machine parts to fix their machines.
